FuseQuery is a real-time Cloud Query Engine implemented in Rust.

Inspired by [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) and powered by [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow).

## Features

* **High Performance** 
  - Everything is Parallelism
  
* **High Scalability**
  - Everything is Distributed
  
* **High Reliability**
  - True Separation of Storage and Compute

## Architecture

## Performance

* **Memory SIMD-Vector processing performance only**
* Dataset: 100,000,000,000 (100 Billion)
* Hardware: AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750U, 8 CPU Cores, 16 Threads
* Rust: rustc 1.49.0 (e1884a8e3 2020-12-29)
* Build with Link-time Optimization and Using CPU Specific Instructions
* ClickHouse server version 21.2.1 revision 54447

|SELECT sum(number) / count(number) FROM system.numbers_mt | (3.09 s.) | **×1.96 slow, (6.07 s.)** <br /> 16.48 billion rows/s., 131.88 GB/s.|
|SELECT sum(number) / count(number), max(number), min(number) FROM system.numbers_mt |(6.73 s.)| **×4.01 slow, (27.59 s.)** <br /> 3.62 billion rows/s., 28.99 GB/s.|

Note:
* ClickHouse system.numbers_mt is <b>16-way</b> parallelism processing
* FuseQuery system.numbers_mt is <b>16-way</b> parallelism processing
