A catalog in Databend is a fundamental organizational concept that assists in efficiently managing and accessing your data sources. It serves as a central repository for metadata information about your data, enabling you to query data from external catalogs without loading the data into Databend. 

Databend provides support for two primary catalog types: [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) and [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/). You can learn more about them on their official websites. Please note that, Databend currently only supports the Parquet format for both Iceberg and Hive dataset files.

For how to work with Apache Iceberg and Apache Hive catalogs in Databend, see the following links:
