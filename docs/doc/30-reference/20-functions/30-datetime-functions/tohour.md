title: toHour
---

Converts a date with time to a UInt8 number containing the number of the hour in 24-hour time (0-23).
This function assumes that if clocks are moved ahead, it is by one hour and occurs at 2 a.m., and if clocks are moved back, it is by one hour and occurs at 3 a.m. (which is not always true â€“ even in Moscow the clocks were twice changed at a different time).

## Syntax

```sql
toHour( <expr> )
```

## Arguments

| Arguments   | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `<expr>` | datetime |

## Return Type

 `UInt8` datatype.
