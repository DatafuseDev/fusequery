  Java Requirements for the JDBC Driver
---
The Databend JDBC driver requires Java LTS (Long-Term Support) versions 1.8 or higher. If the minimum required version of Java is not installed on the client machines where the JDBC driver is installed, you must install either Oracle Java or OpenJDK.

## Oracle Java
Oracle Java currently supports Java 8. For download and installation instructions, go to:

## OpenJDK

OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of Java that provides JDK 8 packages for various Linux environments. Packages for non-Linux environments or higher Java versions are only available through 3rd parties. For more information, go to:
