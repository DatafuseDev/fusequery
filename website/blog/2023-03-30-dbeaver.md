Early this month, I posted introducing bendsql, a CLI tool developed by the Databend team. The tool enables you to connect to your Databend instance, view your databases and tables, and even execute SQL queries in a command line window. For a more user-friendly experience, most of us prefer a GUI tool. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com) is one of the most popular data management tools. It is free, open-source, and supports connections to almost all databases. This post explains how to set up a Databend connection with DBeaver. If you're a new Databender and haven't used DBeaver before, I hope this post can get you started.

When you set up a connection in DBeaver, you need to select a database driver. To connect to Databend, you can use the MySQL driver, or add the [Datebend JDBC driver](https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-jdbc) to the DBeaver.


## Connecting with the MySQL Driver

1. Open DBeaver, and select **Database** > **New Database Connection**.

    A database connection wizard opens up as follows:

2. Select **MySQL**, then click **Next**.
